# 3deify
An experimental image-to-3d model.
This is unfinished and is a work in progress!

# Requirements
To run `create_dataset.py`, you must install Blender and add `blender.exe` to the `PATH` environment variable. Then you can run it from the command line using Blender, for example: `blender -b -P create_dataset.py`
